      <p> Katniss Everdeen is a strong, resourceful girl who becomes a symbol of resistance. Peeta Mellark is compassionate and brave, often acting as her emotional support throughout the Games. Their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, is a bitter former victor who hides pain behind sarcasm but helps them survive. President Snow rules through fear, while Gale symbolizes rebellion, though his methods differ sharply from Katniss’s.

      </header>
      <p> The book explores identity, justice, friendship, and the importance of standing up for what’s right. These themes are meaningful for teens and adults alike, sparking self-reflection. While violence is present, it isn’t gratuitous—it encourages readers to think about power and inequality. A fast-paced plot and emotional depth keep the story gripping while prompting critical thought about government, propaganda, and society.

      <p>The story takes place in Panem, a future version of North America ruled by a wealthy Capitol. Twelve districts live in poverty, controlled through fear and routine punishments like the Hunger Games. Each year, children are forced to fight to the death as a reminder of past rebellion. This dystopian world critiques totalitarianism, showing how extreme inequality and propaganda sustain oppressive systems.</p>

          <h1>How the Hunger Games was Written </h1></header>
        <p>According to Wikapedia, "Collins has said that the inspiration for The Hunger Games came from channel surfing on television. On one channel she observed people competing on a reality show and on another she saw footage of the invasion of Iraq. The two "began to blur in this very unsettling way" and the idea for the book was formed.The Greek myth of Theseus served as a major basis for the story, with Collins describing Katniss as a futuristic Theseus, and Roman gladiatorial games provided the framework. The sense of loss that Collins developed through her father's service in the Vietnam War was also an influence on the story, with Katniss having lost her father at age 11, five years before the story begins.Collins stated that the deaths of young characters and other "dark passages" were the most difficult parts of the book to write, but that she had accepted that passages such as these were necessary to the story.She considered the moments where Katniss reflects on happier moments in her past to be more enjoyable./footer>
