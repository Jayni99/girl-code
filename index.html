      </header>
      <p>The novel explores themes like identity, justice, friendship, and the importance of standing up for what’s right. Though it contains violence, it’s not gratuitous and instead invites readers to reflect critically on power, inequality, and media manipulation. These thought-provoking ideas, paired with the fast-paced plot, engage both teen and adult readers on deeper levels.</p>

          <h1>How the Hunger Games was Written </h1></header>
        <p>According to Wikapedia, "Collins has said that the inspiration for The Hunger Games came from channel surfing on television. On one channel she observed people competing on a reality show and on another she saw footage of the invasion of Iraq. The two "began to blur in this very unsettling way" and the idea for the book was formed.The Greek myth of Theseus served as a major basis for the story, with Collins describing Katniss as a futuristic Theseus, and Roman gladiatorial games provided the framework. The sense of loss that Collins developed through her father's service in the Vietnam War was also an influence on the story, with Katniss having lost her father at age 11, five years before the story begins.Collins stated that the deaths of young characters and other "dark passages" were the most difficult parts of the book to write, but that she had accepted that passages such as these were necessary to the story.She considered the moments where Katniss reflects on happier moments in her past to be more enjoyable.".
